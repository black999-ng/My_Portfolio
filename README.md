# Portfolio — Starter

This is a minimal, modern starter for a young developer portfolio. It includes a responsive layout, hero, projects, skills, and contact sections.

What's included:
- `index.html` — main page
- `css/styles.css` — styling (dark, modern)
- `js/script.js` — small interactivity
- `assets/` — place your images and media here

How to use:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Replace placeholder text and images in `index.html`.
3. Add real project screenshots into `assets/` and update links.
4. Hook the contact form to a backend or a service like Formspree, Netlify Forms, or use a mailto link.

Next improvements:
- Convert to a static site generator (Next.js, Astro) for faster builds and previews.
- Add animations and better accessibility testing.
- Add SEO metadata and Open Graph images.
